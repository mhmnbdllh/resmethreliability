Streamlit page for Internal Consistency reliability analysis.

Covers Cronbach's alpha, KR-20/KR-21, Split-Half reliability (First-Second,
Odd-Even, Maximum variants), Guttman's Lambda (6 forms, raw + standardized
basis), McDonald's Omega (model-implied, observed, and hierarchical), and
ICC(C,k). Also reports full Item Statistics, Summary Item Statistics,
Item-Total Statistics, the Inter-Item Correlation matrix, and Scale
Statistics.
