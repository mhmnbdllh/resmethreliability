          ResMeth-IRA is this toolkit&#39;s dedicated Inter-Rater Agreement
          module &mdash; a formula-documented implementation of eleven
          agreement coefficients (Percentage Agreement, Cohen&#39;s / Fleiss&#39;

          Krippendorff&#39;s &alpha;) spanning dichotomous, nominal, ordinal,
          interval, and ratio rating data with two or more raters. The app
          restricts each coefficient to the data types and rater counts for
          which it is statistically appropriate, reports a standard error or
          confidence interval wherever one is valid, and documents every
          formula with its primary-source citation in the results&#39; Notes
          tab &mdash; so the output can be read, checked, and cited directly
